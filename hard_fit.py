# search for the most fitting spaceship in the database
# 0) envelope space: vertical stretch invariant, horizontal translation invariant, slight deformation tolerant
#    - derivative of the envelope
#    TODO horizontal translation only works if one can cut the spaceship with a vertical line at arbitrary places
#      and get their envelope derivative
#    - the number of lines defines the line-height (the overall height is pre-defined)

# 1) TODO create database (fast search)
